Since he was unfit for surgery due to his old age, it was decided to put him on traction.\n\nDue to prolonged inactivity he developed bronchopneumonia three weeks after and died 6 days later.\n\nAutopsy revealed also fractured neck of left femur, cardiac hypertrophy, chronic fibrous myocarditis and coronary sclerosis.",

    "ILLDEFINED" : [
        "Recording ill-defined conditions as underlying causes on death certificates is of no value for public health. These conditions do not provide any information for decision-makers to guide them in designing preventive health programs.",
        "They can be divided in to four categories",
        "1.  Causes of death which are impossible as an underlying cause of death\n(e.g. infertility, migraine or the broad category of ill-defined conditions, including signs and symptoms)\n\n2.  Immediate or intermediate causes of death which occur somewhere in the causal sequence\n(e.g. Portal hypertension, Pathological fracture, Secondary hypertension, Septicaemia, Liver failure, Renal failure etc.)\n\n3.  Modes of dying\n(e.g. cardiac or respiratory arrest; these are conditions that the person died from, but were not the precipitating condition in the causal sequence leading to death)\n\n4.  Unspecified causes within a larger disease or injury category\n(e.g. ill-defined cancers, ill-defined injury, Congenital heart disease, Respiratory infection, etc.)\n\n"
